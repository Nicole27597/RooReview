# RooReview
Basic MVC for a product review website. Certain features are non-funtioning at the moment due to the site not being connected to a web zone and database.

This website was made using Codeigniter PHP for back-end capabilities, and Bootstrap framework for the front-end.
When connected to a web zone and external database (phpmyadmin), this website allows users to sign up, login in, sign out, search for a product using the search bar, and be taken 
to that products respective page. When users login their username is displayed in the header.
